    "## About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source, object-oriented programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications. It was initially developed by Guido van Rossum, who named it after Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python is popular because it is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, but also because it has many extensions that make it suitable for an enormous range of applications. Other advantages are that it is open-source and runs on all major operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not necessary to compile code into binary machine language before a program can be ran. Instead, the commands are executed in an interpreter, which may be embedded in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things that are worth mentioning upfront and these must be remembered at all times. First of all, Python is case sensitive, so a variable with the name `avariable` is not the same as `Avariable` or `AVARIABLE`. Second, systematic indentation is a feature of the Python language (this will be explained below). Third, Python starts counting at zero, not at one. This sometimes confuses people but it is not that different from the way we count time: The first hour of a day is also numbered zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation (only if allowed on your computer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python consists of the core language and comes with a comprehensive standard library. In addition, there are many third-party packages (or libraries). Scientists and engineers typically choose the Anaconda Python distribution because it includes many of the most useful package already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that the packages are easy to update, and that Anaconda will usually install without major hassles. To install Anaconda go to the website https://www.anaconda.com/download/success and download the installer for your operating system. Once downloaded, double-click on the installer and follow the instructions."
